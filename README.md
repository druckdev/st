## Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.\
For the transparency to work you need a composite manager (e.g. picom,
xcompmgr).


## Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


## Running st
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
